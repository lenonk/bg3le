# Detours is deliberately absent: bg3le hooks via PLT interposition, vtable
# slot patching and call-site patching. SDL2 and Vulkan come from the Steam
# runtime container at run time. oneTBB is deliberately not used at all --
# vendor/compat implements the two concurrent containers bg3se needs over the
# standard library, because libtbb is not in that container.

# libc++'s layout for std::variant, which has to be the game's.
#
# The stable libc++ ABI stores a variant's index as four bytes; the game's
# build stores one, straight after the union, as libstdc++ and MSVC both do.
# That is not a detail: a variant with a small union is a different size, so
# every struct holding one inline is laid out differently from the engine's,
# and bg3le reads those structs by offsetof. libc++ keeps the one-byte form
# behind this macro, which only <variant> reads.
#
# It has to apply to every piece of C++ linked into libbg3le.so, not only
# bg3le's own: protobuf-lite's FailDynamicCast takes a std::variant by value,
# abseil aliases absl::variant to std::variant, and both leave weak template
# instantiations whose mangled names are the same under either layout. So
# they are built with it too, and CMakeLists.txt refuses to configure
# against externals built with anything else. The stamp is how it knows.
