// engine's virtual file system.

// Upstream opens these with StaticSymbols::MakeFileReader, which needs
// ls::FileReader's constructor, and no engine function in the Linux build
// carries a symbol to call. So bg3le reads the archives itself: the index is
// built once from every LSPK under the install, and a loose file on disk
// wins over a packed one the way it does for the engine.
