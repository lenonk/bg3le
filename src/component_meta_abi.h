    // resolves for the one actually held, since the bytes are not the others.
    Variant,
    // Not a field: records that the class also has the fields of the class
    // named in Name. Classes are declared in dependency-free order, so bases
    // are resolved by name at load rather than by pointer.
    Inherit,
    // A component handle: an integer to Lua, or nil when null.

    // A stats condition's id, read as the condition's text.
